Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client for this project was The Gaming Room, a company that had previously released a game called Draw It or Lose It for Android. They were looking to expand the game into a cross-platform version that could run on both web and mobile devices. One of their main goals was to ensure the game could support multiple teams and players, with unique names for each, while making sure only one active game session could run at any time. They also needed a system that would scale well and work consistently across different operating systems.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
One of the things I feel I handled well in this project was breaking down the requirements and creating a domain model that made sense for the game structure. I used an object-oriented design with an Entity base class that made it easy to manage relationships between games, teams, and players. This helped keep the code clean and easier to maintain. I also evaluated different development environments and tools and gave platform recommendations that aligned with the client’s goals, especially in terms of compatibility with Android development.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through the design document ahead of time was really useful when it came to writing the code. It helped me map out the overall structure of the system and avoid common issues before they came up.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I had the chance to improve anything, I’d add more detail to the system architecture section—maybe include a diagram or flowchart to show how the components interact. That would make it easier for someone else on the team to understand how everything connects.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
To meet the user’s expectations, I focused on the technical needs they mentioned, like making sure no duplicate game or team names existed and keeping the system simple to use. By assigning unique IDs to all elements and using a Singleton approach to control game sessions, I was able to meet their goals. Considering user needs early in the design process is crucial because it ensures the final product actually solves the problems it was meant to and provides a better experience.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
When it came to designing the software, I combined object-oriented principles with practical planning and tool research. In the future, I’d also bring in visual aids like diagrams or early wireframes and try to get feedback from users before the development is too far along. That way, the solution can be more user-focused and adjustments can be made earlier in the process.
